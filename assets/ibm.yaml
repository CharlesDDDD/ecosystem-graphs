  name: Prithvi
  organization: IBM
  description: Prithvi is a first-of-its-kind temporal Vision transformer pre-trained
    by the IBM and NASA team on contiguous US Harmonised Landsat Sentinel 2 (HLS)
    data. The model adopts a self-supervised encoder developed with a ViT architecture
    and Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) learning strategy, with an MSE loss function.
