  description: Instacart is augmenting the Instacart app to enable customers to
    ask about food and get inspirational, shoppable answers. This uses ChatGPT alongside
    Instacart’s own AI and product data from their 75,000+ retail partner store
    locations to help customers discover ideas for open-ended shopping goals, such
    as “How do I make great fish tacos?” or “What’s a healthy lunch for my kids?”
    Instacart plans to launch “Ask Instacart” later this year.
