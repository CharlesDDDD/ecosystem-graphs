      \ Authors also discuss the following limitations of the model: \"While SAM\
      \ performs well in general, it is not perfect. It can miss fine structures,\
      \ hallucinates small disconnected components at times, and does not produce\
      \ boundaries as crisply as more computationally intensive methods that “zoom-in”,\
      \ e.g. [18]. In general, we expect dedicated interactive segmentation methods\
      \ to outperform SAM when many points are provided, e.g. [67]. Unlike these\
      \ methods, SAM is designed for generality and breadth of use rather than high\
      \ IoU interactive segmentation. Moreover, SAM can process prompts in real-time,\
      \ but nevertheless SAM's overall performance is not real-time when using a\
      \ heavy image encoder. Our foray into the text-to-mask task is exploratory\
      \ and not entirely robust, although we believe it can be improved with more\
      \ effort. While SAM can perform many tasks, it is unclear how to design simple\
      \ prompts that implement semantic and panoptic segmentation. Finally, there\
      \ are domain-specific tools, such as [7], that we expect to outperform SAM\
      \ in their respective domains.\"\n"
