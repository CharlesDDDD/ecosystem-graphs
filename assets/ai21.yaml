  intended_uses: Jurassic-1 Instruct was trained specifically to handle instructions-only
    prompts ("zero-shot") without examples ("few-shot"). It is the most natural
    way to interact with language models, and it is the best way to get a sense
    of the optimal output for your task without any examples.
